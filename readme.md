Hello peeps, This is Rithan from NIT trichy (ECE) >> Glimpse of my interaction with industry experts and senior talks.
Hope it kick starts your search & reasearch towards MS in VLSI.
All the following information provided is just my opinion & insights from industry experts.

	Princeton - only PHD				
	UCB, UCLA , Umich is under rader but it is costly for my current financial scenrio				
	Umich has good PD course  (backend)				
	UCSD - analog ECS track ( good theory centric course for anlaog and communication circuits, no practical )				
	UTA was good for analog but since one top prof left, analog domain in uta is weak as on fall 22				
	UTA - NO 1 digital design and comp arch ( ICS track ) 				
	Gatech - digital design and comp arch (one of the best coursework so far)				
	ASU -  analog courses are good 				
	Uminn - PD and memory design (Prof.Kim)				
	UWmadison - nanotech and pure semiconductor physics , control systems				
	USC - good for comp arch and digital				
	Purdue - soc design courses are good, comp arch , ML in vlsi 				
	UCSD - CE track ( good digtal vlsi and ML in HLS )				
	NCSU - best for verification course ( complete UVM flow can be learnt )				
	TAMU - really good analog courses				
	Uwashington - good in comp arch ( Prof.taylor)				
	CMU - robotics & mechatronics based programs				
	UIUC - comp arch good 				
	Upenn - good only for emb systems				
	UC boulder - best emb system course 				
	Caltech- too much research based (genrally only PHD) , but worth 100% 				
	Standford - i am not able to find  good courses in VLSI 				
	UWMadison - thesis is best option 				
	Gatech, Uminn - non thesis (course work only )
