## Hello peeps, This is Rithan from NIT trichy (ECE) >> Glimpse of my interaction with industry experts and senior talks.
Hope it kick starts your search for Master program in VLSI (US).
All the following information provided is just my opinion & insights from industry experts.

	Princeton - only PHD				
	UCLA - good digital course, but hectic quarter system left no breathing space for students
	UCLA - have good set of analog courses too, but lot are more theorical courses like UCSD
	Umich has good PD course  (backend)				
	UCSD - analog ECS track ( good theory centric course for anlaog and communication circuits, no practical )				
	UTA was good for analog but since one top prof left, analog domain in uta is weak as on fall 22				
	UTA - NO 1 digital design and comp arch ( ICS track ) 				
	Gatech - digital design and comp arch (one of the best coursework so far)				
	ASU -  analog courses are good, but not well ranked			
	Uminn - PD and memory design (Prof.Kim)				
	UW madison - nanotech and pure semiconductor physics , control systems				
	USC - good for comp arch and digital				
	Purdue - soc design courses are good, comp arch , ML in vlsi(Prof. Anand & vijay raghu,Prof. vijay kumar_comp Arch guru ) 			
	UCSD - CE track ( good digtal vlsi and ML in HLS )				
	NCSU - best for verification course ( complete UVM flow can be learnt )				
	TAMU - really good analog courses				
	Uwashington - good in comp arch ( Prof.taylor)				
	CMU - robotics & mechatronics based programs				
	UIUC - comp arch good 				
	Upenn - good only for emb systems				
	UC boulder - best emb system course 				
	Caltech- too much research based (genrally only PHD) , but worth 100% 				
	Standford - i am not able to find  good courses in VLSI 				
	UW Madison - thesis is best option 				
	Gatech, Uminn - non thesis (course work only )				
					
          		
# TOP UNIVERSITY IN VLSI
	
	UC Berkeley	
	UT Austin	
	UCLA	
	Georgia Tech	
	University of Michigan	
	UIUC	
	UC San Diego	
	Texas A&M (good physical design courses)	
	University of Minnesota (excellent physical design courses)	
	NC state (good verification and computer architecture courses)	
	University of Southern California (good verification & physical design courses)	
	Arizona state (good physical design courses)	
	UT Dallas(Rf, analog)	
	San Jose State University (great job prospects though not as well ranked)
	
### Suggestions				
	Apply to UC boulder,Upenn only if u have interest in embedded system 						
	Apply to UWisconsin only for nanotech and control system.Personally i didnt like computer system courses over there.				
	Apply to Uminn only for PD and memory design
	USC - general admits are 9+ gpa and tier 1 college students
	ASU - always the safest college for decent profile considering huge class size
	NCSU - generally sees Quant score (165+) and awa score (3+)
	UT - need Ultra mass gre score and good exposure in Industry
	Gatech - good research experience
	UCSD - stellar Research and good Gre can get u there
	Purdue - 315+ gre and decent research admits
	Uminn is safest if u have decent gpa of 8.5+ and nice research bcakground.
	
Also, LOR and SOP places a huge role in master application. Curtail ur statement of purpose acc to neccesities of particular university. 

For ex: 
> UCSD gives priority also to your research experience and extra curricular activities in UG's. you can brief abt that in your sop. 

> Purdue checks if u are aligned into track you wanna pursue.How well you can sync with interested prof's work. Talking with prospective students at the university can get you these kind of insights.

> Gatech,USC is GPA centric , so it is important that we touch upon academic records in SOP.
	
## Generic profile of admitted students	FALL'22	
	CHeck once yocket of past yr admits		
	GPA : 9+	min of 2 RA + extra curricular	
	GRE : 310+	TOEFL: 95+   IELTS : 7.5+
	
Personally, GPA do plays major role in your MS admission, but not the only factor.You can still compensate with graduate examination record score (320+). 
	
# Following are my applied colleges ::(
								
	#ambi	     #mod	  #safe	
	UT	    purdue	    usc	
	gatech	    Uminn	    ncsu	
	ucsd	    Wisconsin       asu	

UCB, UCLA , Umich were under my rader of intial shortlist but it is costly for my current financial scenrio. So I didnt apply.	
	
# My admits Fall '22
	1.USC ( admit on jan 14) 		
	2.Asu ( u will get admit in a month, jan28) 		
	3.Ucsd ( Feb 6) 		
	4.ncsu (feb 28)		
	5.uminn (mar1)		
	6.wisconsin (mar 8)		
	7.georgia tech (mar 23)		
	8.purdue (apr3)	

# I am still waiting for my UT decision.
